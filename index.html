        <p>Writing about yourself is a bit awkward, the hardest part is figuring out how to start talking about yourself - but I'll give it shot. Professionally, my career in coding has only
        beginning but I am incredibly excited about this field. The possibities of code seem endless and I've found it difficult to put the assignments down because it's such a fun puzzle.
        I graduated with honors from University of North Texas, my Bachelor of Science degree is in Integrative Studies with focuses in Biology, Public Service, and Economics.  
         <br><br>
        My primary goal is to continue learning all that I can about coding, as this field is so vast and has no shortages of new things to learn. My plan is to use it to pursue a career in 
        bioinformatics. However, I'm leaving my options open moving forward from this class because there are so many avenues left to explore.
